*** My MNIST Neural Network ***
Very basic system designed to interpret the MNIST dataset through a neural network.
Currently achieves ~94% accuracy.
Network class is designed to be applicable to any neural network (i.e inputs and outputs vectors, all other handling such as using the brightest node is on user handling to maintain generalization/abstraction).
